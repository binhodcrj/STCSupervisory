# STC Supervisory

STC Supervisory is a project that I am developing to be presented in a final evaluation panel of my technical course in industrial automation. 
The final software will be able to communicate with hardware via serial communication, receiving and sending data through this communication protocol.
It will receive data from the level of a reservoir and compare it with the level value at the set point and as the level of this reservoir undergoes variations 
it will apply a PID control to correct this disturbance and maintain the desired level or as close to this value as possible.

## 🚀 Getting started

## ⚙️ Running the tests

You can load the serial_control.ino file present in the arduino_test1 folder on an Arduino that has an LED connected to digital port 13 and perform the STC Supervisory test in the current version.

## 🛠️ Built with
