 This program aims to perform a test with the STC Supervisory software in its version 1.0.1. A command 
 will be sent through the serial port where a LED connected to pin 13 of the Arduino should turn on or 
 off according to the command sent. In addition, a confirmation message must be sent by the Arduino to 
 the supervisory software.

 In STC Supervisory: 
 --> send the L command to turn on the LED 
 --> send the D command to turn off the LED.
